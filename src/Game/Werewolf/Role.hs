    --   truth and eliminate the threat to Foug√®res. The task before them will not be easy, but a
    --   certain few have learnt some tricks over the years that may turn out rather useful.

    --   The Villagers must lynch all of the Werewolves.

-- | Role definitions require only a few pieces of information.
--   Most of the game logic behind a role is implemented in "Game.Werewolf.Command" and
--   "Game.Werewolf.Engine".
--
--   The @balance@ attribute on a role indicates the allegiance it favours. For example, a Simple
--   Werewolf has a balance of -4 while the Seer has a balance of 2. A balance of 0 means it favours
--   neither allegiance.
--
--   N.B., role equality is defined on just the 'name' as a role's 'allegiance' may change
--   throughout the game.
